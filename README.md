# TinyRenderer in Modern C++

This project is an implementation of the [TinyRenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) project, rewritten using modern C++20 features.

## Project Goals

This project serves two primary purposes:

1. **A Learning Tool for C++20:** The codebase is intentionally written using modern C++ standards (`C++20`) to serve as a practical exercise for learning the language. For many, C++20 feels like a new language, and this project is a sandbox for exploring its features.

2. **A Foundation for Advanced Graphics:** By building a solid understanding of a classic software rasterizer, the ultimate goal is to move on to studying more advanced topics in computer graphics, specifically **differentiable rasterization**.

## Building

The project uses CMake for building.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Profiling
